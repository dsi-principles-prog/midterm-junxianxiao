# Principles of Programming Midterm project

## Introduction and problem
The dataset I choose is Japan Hostel Dataset. Since the 2020 Olympic Game is going to hold in Japen, tourists' interests about visiting Japan is increasing. However, the price of hotels in Japan are not friendly. Therefore hostels are a suitable choise for tourists because of its friendly price. 
In this assignment, I want to accomplish a dataset to give tourists suggetion when choosing hostels. I also want to conduct research in the relationship between some columns in the data, such as the relationship between the price and score of distance, atmosphere, cleanliness and so on.
